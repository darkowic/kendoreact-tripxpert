The topic:

https://dev.to/httpjunkie/react-hack-55eb

    I have created a React application to start from which can be cloned from GitHub:
    https://github.com/httpJunkie/kendoreact-tripxpert
    
    The Challenge: Try and recreate the functionality and or style in the working example:
    https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/tripxpert/
    
    Our KendoReact components could help to make the job easier, they can be found at:
    www.KendoReact.com


## What I managed to do

* Navigation bar improvements
* A proxy server to avoid CORS issues when fetching the data from `demos.telerik.com` server
* Home page recommended destinations
* Destinations page
* Half of the destination page

## Install Packages & Run 

Run API server:

    cd server && npm install && npm start

In second console start app server from root dir

    npm install
    npm start
